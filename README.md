Maths Wizard is an application that goes beyond regular conventional calculators that only carry out basic tasks of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. Math Wizard is responsive on all media devices. Maths Wizard is an AI Maths Calculator
that is programmed to solve users' mathematical problems, starting from the less calculations to the advanced equations. The Calculator is
currently being built on a smaller scale and continues to advance with more ability to tackle bigger problems.
